Figure  1:   Targeted  Attack. Malicious  instances  generated  for  a  sparse  attack  with  different query budgets using our SparseEvo attack algorithm employed on black-box models built for the ImageNet task. With an extremely sparse perturbation (_78 perturbed pixels over a total of 50,176pixels_), an image with ground-truth label **traffic lightis** misclassified as a **street sign**.
